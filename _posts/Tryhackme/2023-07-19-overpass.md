This is a machine by group of broke Computer Science students as they try to make a password manager.

Nothing interesting found in webpage. Next we will search for the hidden directories with gobuster:
```bash
	sudo gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u http://10.10.48.98
```
![49bee95366ac290018188c47ebefe77a.png](/_resources/49bee95366ac290018188c47ebefe77a.png)

We found some results as shown above, we will visit /admin now:
Tried to login with Admin:Password and we can see the `Incorrect Credential` error message.

![d9d8c70d1a6a814d7f71cae5c7363802.png](/_resources/d9d8c70d1a6a814d7f71cae5c7363802.png)

Now we will check the process in the inspector tab

![ef800e2587c057745fdf83caeec0662b.png](/_resources/ef800e2587c057745fdf83caeec0662b.png)

We can see that login.js file in involved in processing our login request.

![b89a54de71295f32f87fe7ae5809829e.png](/_resources/b89a54de71295f32f87fe7ae5809829e.png)

After loooking at the script, we can see `SessionToken` cookie is being set on success response.

# Gaining Access

We have set the Cookie as `SessionToken`

![8aad125fa716a719bb1db39901cfc4b5.png](/_resources/8aad125fa716a719bb1db39901cfc4b5.png)

And access the **Administrator Area**:

Now we will **ssh** to the james account with this private key.

But we need passphrase for the key, so we will give id_rsa to ssh2john:
```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/thm/overpass1]
└─$ ssh2john id_rsa >id_rsa.hash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/thm/overpass1]
└─$ john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt id_rsa.hash

```

John cracked the hash with rockyou.txt:

Then successfully **ssh** to the james account and read the user flag:

![d2d04112e4ff18af0394b4970be6216b.png](/_resources/d2d04112e4ff18af0394b4970be6216b.png)

# Privilege Escalation

We cannot check sudo command as we don't have password for james account, next we checked for set suid binaries but nothing interesting found for privilege escalation.

From the cron job we find a curl executing buildscript.sh from overpass.thm to bash

![8df712ba6b5236d1c978028e31f32407.png](/_resources/8df712ba6b5236d1c978028e31f32407.png)

Then, we checked our /etc/hosts permissions

As we can write to /etc/hosts file, we can take advantage of this by replacing the overpass.thm ip to our attacker machine ip and host the malicious buildscript.sh. So, let's do it:

![b52ecc3f2a808d016a94e5a3be44f1c8.png](/_resources/b52ecc3f2a808d016a94e5a3be44f1c8.png)

Next we have to host the malicious script file under downloads/src folder as the curl command will look for this path in our attacker machine.

![8c95f16ff150d415ca15e1fdb4b67b02.png](/_resources/8c95f16ff150d415ca15e1fdb4b67b02.png)

Now, we need to run the nc listner and python server for the curl to request our malicious script

![85fbc926d917e66e7f64cf5cad24d5fe.png](/_resources/85fbc926d917e66e7f64cf5cad24d5fe.png)

Once we received the successful `GET` request to our python server, we got the root shell:

![b31600db3f55e4ccbb963576f168d637.png](/_resources/b31600db3f55e4ccbb963576f168d637.png)

**Congratulations! We have rooted this machine.**
